                    <p><strong>Hello there.</strong>
                    <p>Welcome to my site employer, friend or stranger surfing through the web who landed here.</p>
                    <p>The about page is always the hardest because it should grab the viewers attention and make you want to read more. Well, thats exactly what I am going to try and do. </p>

                    <h3>A little bit about me:</h3> 
                    <p>My name is Yash Shah. Yash means <strong>victory or glory</strong></p>

                    <p>I am a proud resident of Kitchener-Waterloo, and as all of you know it is a beacon of entrepreneurs and startups. Having lived here for few years, I've been exposed to the startup environment where I've got to learn a lot about the tech side of things but also the entrepreneurial side as well. You can read about my work experience at a startup<a id="work-link" href='#'> here </a></p>

                    <h3>Education</h3>
                    <p>
                    I was enrolled at the University of Guelph for my first year and now, I recently transferred to the University of Waterloo for Honors Math Co-op starting from 2A. </p>
                    <!-- <p>In the summer, I worked for a startup called Chalk.com and it was an incredible experience. First of all, startups are so informal in nature where everyone is a peer and it is just a friendly environment. But at the same time, it is very fast paced, a person doesnt know if that startup is going to exist next year.</p> -->

                    <h3>Background:</h3>
                    <p>I have always been fascinated by technology, whether it was how remote control cars worked or how they would make cartoons and animated movies; these kinds of stuff really intrigued me. I think the first sign to why I chose this profession started showing in Grade 9. I was on the robotics team and we had to assemble a robot that would perform certain tasks. Assembling the robot was cool but I was blown away by the software side of it. I helped write code that made the robot move depending on remote control actions. So, writing two lines of code that moved the robot forward blew my mind. I finally understood how a remote control car worked and being able to create something similar to my favorite childhood toy was incredible.</p>
                    
                    <p>Being on the robotics team was one of the best experiences I've had. It was a blast working with my teammates and we got the opportunity to go Orlando, Florida to compete in the Vex World Championship 2012.</p>
                    
                    <p>It was in grade 10 where I got to see more of the software side when I had to build a game in Flash Action Script. This was where I learned more about computer programming and got a better idea of what it can really do. <a id="game-link" href="#">View Game</a></p>

                    <h3>Interests:</h3>
                    <p>
                    For people who don't know me. I am a huge Suits (TV Show) fan. After watching the show, I think I dreamt about being a lawyer in real life and I thought about how that would play out. But then I woke up and just sticked to thinking about the show as just a show.</p>
                    <p>I would choose Harvey as my favorite character from that show because he is smart, confident and is awesome at reading people. Plus, he is the <strong>"best goddamn closer New York City has ever seen"</strong> One of my favorite quotes by him is <strong>"I don't play the odds, I play the man"</strong>.</p>

                    <p>A little synopsis of Suits if you are interested:</p>
                    <p>"One of Manhattan/s top corporate lawyers (Gabriel Macht) sets out to recruit a new hotshot associate and hires the only guy that impresses him â€“ a brilliant but unmotivated college dropout (Patrick J. Adams). Though he isn't actually a lawyer, this legal prodigy has the book smarts of a Harvard law grad and the street smarts of a hustler. However, in order to serve justice and save their jobs, both these unconventional thinkers must continue the charade."</p>
                    
                    <p>Apart from that, I am also a huge baller. I love to play the sport as well as keep up to date with the season and new things happening in the league. Being from Toronto, I support the Toronto Raptors but after the way they played last playoffs, I am losing faith in them. My favorite team is Cleveland Cavaliers because of Lebron James. I admire him as a player but more as a better human being, helping the city of Cleveland and its people through his charitable foundation.

                                <p> I created this as final project to grade 12 programming class. I used a library called LibGDX that does the heavy lifting such as creating vectors and such. This was all coded in Java. </p>
