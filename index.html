          Hi there, I'm Yash.
          I am currently a third year Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo in Waterloo, Ontario. I am an aspiring software developer looking to work on interesting but impactful projects.
          <br />
          <br />
          I have had a few work experiences under my belt and got the opportunity to work at some really interesting companies such as Wave, QuickTapSurvey and Chalk.com.

          <div class="work-section--body">
            For my third coop, I got the opportunity to work at Wave located in Toronto as a Mobile Engineer. One reason I chose this company was because I wanted to do mobile development and they were starting to use React Native for their mobile platform and I was interested in learning it.
            <br />
            <br />
            During my time on the mobile team, I was working on building their new invoicing app for iOS and Android.
            The invoicing app allows you to create and send beautiful customized invoices, receive notifications when you've been paid, record payments, send reminders and receipts and also accept credit card payments to get paid even faster.

          <div class="work-section--body">
            Before I ended my third coop at Wave, I got a return offer to come back for another coop. I didn't hesitate to come back because to me, three things stood out at Wave which made me want to come back. Those are:
            <br />
            - The company values
            <br />
            - The people
            <br />
            - The work and the impact made on entrepreneurs and their business
            <br />
            <br />
            I decided to join a different team to gain a more diverse experience of the company plus gain different skills. For my fourth coop, I joined the Platform and API team at Wave. The primary tech stack I was working with was Python and Django. I joined at the right time as they were starting to use GraphQL for their new APIs. I got to be part of creating the foundation and understand the whole flow from the design phase all the way to release phrase.

            QuickTapSurvey was where I worked for my second coop. QuickTapSurvey is a startup that is paving the way with innovative solutions for lead capture, research and feedback. With iOS and Android apps for phones and tablets, it is easy to collect data anywhere with their offline mode. 
            I was on the Android development team where I was adding new features and fixing bugs to their Android app.

            I was doing mostly web development and using Ruby on Rails and React for the frontend.

        <div class="work-section--body">
          Slack Translate is a Slack command which takes in a word or phrase and spits out the translations in French, Spanish and Portuguese. During my coop term at QuickTapSurvey, we supported 4 languages; EN, ES, FR, PT, thus localizing a word or phrase into four different languages. The current way this was done was going on Google Translate and typing the word or phrase and selecting the languages you want to translate. This caught my attention as this was a very inefficient way and it slowed down development time. Since we used Slack as our primary communication, I decided to create a Slack command to make this task more efficient. 
          <br />
          <br />
          Since we kept a collection of phrases we localized, this command first looks at our localization db and if the phrase is not found or a similar match is not found, it will use an online translation API.
