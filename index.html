                    <p>Hello there.
                    <p>Welcome to my site employer, friend or stranger surfing through the web who landed here.</p>
                    <p>The about page is always the hardest because it should grab the viewers attention and make you want to read more. Well, thats exactly what I am going to try and do. </p>
                    <h3>A little bit about me:</h3> 
                    <p>
                    My name is Yash Shah. Yash means <strong>victory or glory</strong>. More stuff to come later.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Education</h3>
                    <p>
                    I was enrolled at the University of Guelph for my first year and now I recently transferred to the University of Waterloo for Honours Math Co-op starting from 2A. </p>

                    <p>I am a proud resident of Kitchener-Waterloo, and as all of you know it is a beacon of entrepreneurs and startups. Having lived here for few years, I've been exposed to the startup environment where I've got to learn alot about the tech side of things but also the entrprenurial side as well. You can read about my work experience at a startup<a id="work-link" href='#'> here </a></p>
                    <br/>
                    <!-- <p>In the summer, I worked for a startup called Chalk.com and it was an incredible experience. First of all, startups are so informal in nature where everyone is a peer and it is just a friendly environment. But at the same time, it is very fast paced, a person doesnt know if that startup is going to exist next year.</p> -->
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
                    <h3>Background:</h3>
                    <p>I have always been fascinated by technology, whether it was how remote control cars worked or how they would make cartoons and animated movies; these kinds of stuff really intrigued me. I think the first sign to why I chose this profession started showing in Grade 9. I was on the robotics team and we had to assemble a robot that would perform certain tasks. Assembling the robot was cool but I was blown away by the software side of it. I helped write code that made the robot move depending on remote control actions. I finally understood how a remote control car worked and being able to create someting similar to my favorite childhood toy was incredible.</p>
                    <p>Being on the robotics team was one of the best experiences I've had. It was a blast working with my teammates and also we got to go to Orlando, Florida to compete in the Vex World Championship 2012</p>
                    <p>It was in grade 10 where I got to see more of the software side when I had to build a game in Flash Actionscript. This was where I learned more about computer programming and got a little taste of what it can do. <a id="game-link" href="#">View Game</a></p>
                    <br/>
                    <h3>Interests:</h3>
                    <p>
                    For people who dont know me. I am a huge Suits (TV Show) fan. After watching the show, there was a split second in my life where I was leaning towards choosing being a lawyer. I would choose Harvey as my favorite character from that show because he is smart, confident and is awesome at reading peopele. Plus, he is the <strong>"best goddamn closer this city has ever seen"</strong> One of my favorite quotes by him is <strong>"I dont play the odds, I play the man"</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                    I am also a huge baller. I love to play the sport as well as keep upto date with the season and new things happening in the league. Being from Toronto, I support the Toronto Raptors but after the way they played last playofss, I am losing faith in them. My favorite team is Cleveland Cavaliers because of Lebron James. I admire him as a player but more as a better human being, helping the city of Cleveland and its people through his charitible foundation.

                                    <li> 1. Copy the APK to your phone.</li>
                                    <li> 2. If you don't have a FileManager, download one. I use Astro File Manager (its free)</li>
                                    <li> 3. Go to Settings>Security and check the "Unknown Sources" box </li>
